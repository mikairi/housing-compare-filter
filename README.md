RIT Housing site comparison tool
===
AngularJS apps for the comparing/filtering tools
on RIT Housing. http://www-staging.rit.edu/fa/housing/content/compare-housing

## Development
Source code for the apps can be found under `javascripts/` folder. CodeKit is
used to minify and generate source maps, though you are free to use any other
tool.

`index.html` and `compare.html` are mock pages for quick preview during
development for the filter and compare apps, respectively.

`interceptors.js` turns relative URLs from $http calls to absolute URLs, useful
when developing on local machine.
